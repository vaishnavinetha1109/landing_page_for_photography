    <h3>My Passion is NATURE PHOTOGRAPHY...</h3>
    <P>Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.</P>
    <p>This introduction to photography is written for beginners, with several tips and suggestions to take your skills as far as possible. However, writing an introduction to photography is like writing an introduction to words; as amazing and important as it is, photography can be almost limitlessly complex. What separates inspiring photographs from ordinary ones, and how can you improve the quality of your own work? This article lays a foundation to answer to those questions and more.</p>
    <p>The natural world is a gorgeous and rewarding subject for a photographer to explore. And the best part is, anyone can do it: Whether youâ€™re an amateur or a self-employed or freelance professional photographer, nature provides a dizzying array of patterns, insects and animals, bodies of water, and geologic formations to document.
